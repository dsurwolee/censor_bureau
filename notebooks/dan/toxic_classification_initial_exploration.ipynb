I haven't had a chance to go through and do all the tagging and referencing yet since work calls but I am extremely confident in the scientific factual basis of everything stated in here.  The referencing can pretty much be all made to the book \"\"Particle Imaging Velocimetry A practical guide\"\" by Raffel, Willert, Wereley and Kompenhans if someone can add it.  Also, not sure how to exactly do that as it all can be found in numerous scientific journals, databases, etc. but is so conveniently placed all in that one book.  The only thing I am unsure about as I have no experience with is Molecular Tagging Velocimetry.  To put it simply, I would like to keep technique defects in the summaries but I don't know what this one's is.  To put is bluntly, the description as it is now is too good to be true.  I know it has defects and problems, I don't know what they are.  The fact is the technique was developed in 97ish and is not in widespread use.  If the description were accurate, everyone would use it.  I have met or heard of not one person using it, which means there is some big flaw in the technique that if someone can find, be my guest to add it.  Everything else, please post on discussion page before editing critical information as I am positive what I have said can be completely defended but am open to solid arguments.  I won't be pigheaded about it.  Also, anyone with knowledge of tomographic PIV please expand the section.  It is a volumetric analysis technique that I know of and know its new, but know nothing about.\"</td>\n",

The other option is to continue placing pictures in articles, but even when there are a lot of them, I actually hate deleting images once they are up, either because of my own reticence in undoing what others have done, or out of respect for the visual image.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.  If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

The SPLC's opinion of the show is referenced throughout.  At the very least, your edit should be amended to read that The Political Cesspool has hosted FORMER members of the Ku Klux Klan. In fact, the only one I can find for sure is David Duke, who has also been interviewed by every major talk radio and television program in the country.  (Perhaps it should read, \"\"a former member of the Ku Klux Klan.\"\")  Furthermore, Duke was in the Klan in the 1970's, nearly three decades before The Political Cesspool first went on the air.  Does Wolf Blitzer's Wiki entry read that he has hosted Klan members?  Duke has appeared on Blitzer's show.  There are already many people who feel that this article is flagrantly biased.  Right or wrong, to have it read as though this radio program frequently interviews current members of the \"\"Ku Klux Klan\"\" is misleading.  Regardless of its ideology, this show has had many big names as guests, as Stonemason points out.\"</td>\n",

I came here expecting to find a link to that article, wherever it may be, and couldn't find any. -  | Talk   .  (moult with my mallards)   A lot of this coverage is over at Cyclone Nargis.  Sadly, there just isn't a lot of information out there since access to the country is so tightly controlled, and even the assessment teams on the ground probably don't have the information we'd expect to see.     Name   in the article, some parts say Burma, and some say Myanmar.  I think we should calll it Myanmar, since it may not be recognized by many countries, but that is the official (inter)national name.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)    Please read the tag at the top of the page.  The name is under dispute.     Moved the Page Move Protection tag to talk page   There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the \"\"dispute tag\"\" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.    Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The \"\"non-endorsement\"\" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.    You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the \"\"Dispute\"\" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith. Please reconsider your reversion, the last thing I want is an edit war of any sort.    Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only \"\"sensible solution\"\". The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL. Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates. The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it. The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus). It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?      Because disputes regarding page moves aren't what the user should be reading.  \"</td>\n",

You might say that because, upon reading the text of the statute, and comparing it with what Senator T. Cotton, et al, did, definitely leads to the conclusion that a felony has been committed. Cotton is a shoot-from-the-hip pistol-packer, and he snookered 45 other U.S. Senators into signing a letter to a foreign power, warning our worst enemy not to negotiate with a sitting president.

I noticed that you made a change to an article, Tom Cotton, but you didn't provide a reliable source. It's been removed and archived in the page history for now, but if you'd like to include a citation and re-add it, please do so! If you need guidance on referencing, please see the referencing for beginners tutorial, or if you think I made a mistake, you can leave me a message on my talk page. Thank you. Dwpaul Talk   Information icon Please do not add commentary or your own personal analysis to Wikipedia articles, as you did to Tom Cotton. Doing so violates Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy and breaches the formal tone expected in an encyclopedia. Thank you. Dwpaul Talk   Please learn to properly add and format citations. I have edited your entry at Tom Cotton to do so and to remove the quote you inserted from the Logan Act, the inclusion of which here is still editorialization. Instead, I linked to the Logan Act, where readers can judge its relevance for themselves. Also, I'm not sure where or how you obtained my full name, but it is unnecessary (and unwelcome) that you included it in your edit summaries. Please read WP:OUTING. My name as a Wikipedia editor is Dwpaul, and if you name me in an edit summary please use only that name. If you use any other name for me in the future, I will bring it up at WP:AN/I.

       "      <td>\"   Conflict of Interest   Pm_shef: This is an attempt to resolve the concerns that relate to your conduct on Wikipedia and the editing of articles that you are personally involved in.     As you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP:NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written.   Here is the fulltext, from WP:NOT:   Wikipedia is not a soapbox Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not: Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a \"\"sympathetic point of view\"\" for every article. Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: \"\"Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.\"\"  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability. Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small \"\"garage\"\" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability. -  I understand that you've written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan-related articles. That's a commendable position. I'm sure there are many subjects and articles of interest to you on Wikipedia that do not relate to your father or his opponents. Do I understand your position correctly? And is this approach of abstention one that you permanently take? If so, I again commend that position. I trust, as I'm sure you do, that the administrators and the contributors to Wikipedia will maintain quality articles about worthy and reputable subjects.  \"</td>\n",

       "2      \"   \"\"Points of interest\"\"   I removed the \"\"points of interest\"\" section you added because it seemed kind of spammy.

If you want to reply, just put your reply here and add {{talkback|Jamiegraham08}} on my talkpage.   \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "10     \"  Well I just finished a good bit of editing.  I haven't had a chance to go through and do all the tagging and referencing yet since work calls but I am extremely confident in the scientific factual basis of everything stated in here.  The referencing can pretty much be all made to the book \"\"Particle Imaging Velocimetry A practical guide\"\" by Raffel, Willert, Wereley and Kompenhans if someone can add it.  Also, not sure how to exactly do that as it all can be found in numerous scientific journals, databases, etc. but is so conveniently placed all in that one book.  The only thing I am unsure about as I have no experience with is Molecular Tagging Velocimetry.  To put it simply, I would like to keep technique defects in the summaries but I don't know what this one's is.  To put is bluntly, the description as it is now is too good to be true.  I know it has defects and problems, I don't know what they are.  The fact is the technique was developed in 97ish and is not in widespread use.  If the description were accurate, everyone would use it.  I have met or heard of not one person using it, which means there is some big flaw in the technique that if someone can find, be my guest to add it.  Everything else, please post on discussion page before editing critical information as I am positive what I have said can be completely defended but am open to solid arguments.

       "12     Uh oh, you called my bluff. I am intimidated by the number of images you possess (7000!). And though I am a painter and teacher, I am blissfully ignorant about most workings of the computer. I think that the best way to go would be to upload them to the commons, put captions on them, and place them under the proper headings (here I would also suggest you ask a more experienced art editor than I, someone like Wetman, Caravaggisti, Ewulp, or Celithimus, for their adviceyou will find their contributions throughout the histories of artists' entries... maybe they'll say I'm all wrong). The other option is to continue placing pictures in articles, but even when there are a lot of them, I actually hate deleting images once they are up, either because of my own reticence in undoing what others have done, or out of respect for the visual image. That being said, if there is any way I can help, I would be glad to. It is clear that you have a great collection of photos, and that you are very generous.

       "14     \" May 2008 (UTC)  Notability of Your New Heart  A tag has been placed on Your New Heart requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.  If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.  For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

       "15     \"  While I agree that this article isn't FA material, I must suggest that your added criticism in the lead is also repetitive.  The SPLC's opinion of the show is referenced throughout.  At the very least, your edit should be amended to read that The Political Cesspool has hosted FORMER members of the Ku Klux Klan. In fact, the only one I can find for sure is David Duke, who has also been interviewed by every major talk radio and television program in the country.  (Perhaps it should read, \"\"a former member of the Ku Klux Klan.\"\")  Furthermore, Duke was in the Klan in the 1970's, nearly three decades before The Political Cesspool first went on the air.  Does Wolf Blitzer's Wiki entry read that he has hosted Klan members?  Duke has appeared on Blitzer's show.  There are already many people who feel that this article is flagrantly biased.  Right or wrong, to have it read as though this radio program frequently interviews current members of the \"\"Ku Klux Klan\"\" is misleading.

       "21     \"   Another AfD stats example   I hope you don't mind me letting you know about these examples. I don't know if there's anything you can do to refine how the tool works, but I just thought it would be good for you to know certain examples on it. In regards to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deathlands, the tool closed it as Merge, presumably because it pulled out the word merge from the closing statement. However, the close is really more of an N/A, or a no consensus if you require specific terminology, since the result was that there couldn't be any real outcome for such a huge joint nomination of articles. serenC \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "95819  \"  __TOC__   Current events   Might we want either a temporary hatnote or a \"\"see also\"\" for the present humanitarian crisis? I came here expecting to find a link to that article, wherever it may be, and couldn't find any. -  | Talk   .  (moult with my mallards)   A lot of this coverage is over at Cyclone Nargis.  Sadly, there just isn't a lot of information out there since access to the country is so tightly controlled, and even the assessment teams on the ground probably don't have the information we'd expect to see.     Name   in the article, some parts say Burma, and some say Myanmar.  I think we should calll it Myanmar, since it may not be recognized by many countries, but that is the official (inter)national name.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)    Please read the tag at the top of the page.  The name is under dispute.     Moved the Page Move Protection tag to talk page   There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the \"\"dispute tag\"\" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.    Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The \"\"non-endorsement\"\" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.    You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the \"\"Dispute\"\" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith. Please reconsider your reversion, the last thing I want is an edit war of any sort.    Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only \"\"sensible solution\"\". The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL. Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates. The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it. The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus). It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?      Because disputes regarding page moves aren't what the user should be reading.  \"   \n",

       "95822  \"==T. COTTON LETTER TO THE AYATOLLAHS OF IRAN==  DWP:  Including the text of a U.S. penal statute is \"\"editorialization\"\"? You might say that because, upon reading the text of the statute, and comparing it with what Senator T. Cotton, et al, did, definitely leads to the conclusion that a felony has been committed. Cotton is a shoot-from-the-hip pistol-packer, and he snookered 45 other U.S. Senators into signing a letter to a foreign power, warning our worst enemy not to negotiate with a sitting president. You obviously like Cotton, so you don't want people to read the law which he violated. Que sera sera.   Tom Cotton[edit]  Information icon Hello, I'm Dwpaul. I noticed that you made a change to an article, Tom Cotton, but you didn't provide a reliable source. It's been removed and archived in the page history for now, but if you'd like to include a citation and re-add it, please do so! If you need guidance on referencing, please see the referencing for beginners tutorial, or if you think I made a mistake, you can leave me a message on my talk page. Thank you. Dwpaul Talk   Information icon Please do not add commentary or your own personal analysis to Wikipedia articles, as you did to Tom Cotton. Doing so violates Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy and breaches the formal tone expected in an encyclopedia. Thank you. Dwpaul Talk   Please learn to properly add and format citations. I have edited your entry at Tom Cotton to do so and to remove the quote you inserted from the Logan Act, the inclusion of which here is still editorialization. Instead, I linked to the Logan Act, where readers can judge its relevance for themselves. Also, I'm not sure where or how you obtained my full name, but it is unnecessary (and unwelcome) that you included it in your edit summaries. Please read WP:OUTING. My name as a Wikipedia editor is Dwpaul, and if you name me in an edit summary please use only that name. If you use any other name for me in the future, I will bring it up at WP:AN/I.

       "95824  I do apologize once more to you for my unkind insult. As is traditional among Irish-Americans in Boston on Saint Patrick's Day, I got myself rather seriously intoxicated that evening, which is a lousy excuse as I edit drunk not all that infrequently, but having suffered an unexpected and tragic death in my family on Monday, I was additionally distressed and upset more than I had fully realized. As such, I beg you not to take my lashing out personally, as I was simply suffering an incoherent rage which could have ended up being directed at anyone. Again, I am deeply sorry.  talk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

My opinion is that a dictionary article, mis-placed here in the encyclopaedia, that has been deleted should stay deleted.  \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "95827  Calling someone the archetypical unscientific economist is clearly ad hominem. What's more, it is not relevant to an article about a school of thought. Such smears belong in the articles about the specific person you are smearing. If you want to go down that road, the whole criticism section could be filled with things mainstream economists have said about Austrian economists. That doesn't add anything to the informative value of the article. Regarding the predictions, I would remind you that I was against that whole section to begin with, but it was you among others that wanted it, without any consideration of what economic predictions actually are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "95836  \" I believe you're out of line. You're speculating that fruitless debates would pop up. But why would they? Why would any editor want to fight about the title of a page that is not causing any problem whatsoever. Its not like if the title is completely irrelevant, or if people searching for a certain article are not getting there because of this article's title. No, there is no problem. Moving it will just be a by-product of someone's Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. No guidelines are being violated, no problems are being created, and there's no fundamental reason to move the page.

       "95839  \"   Conflict of Interest   Pm_shef: This is an attempt to resolve the concerns that relate to your conduct on Wikipedia and the editing of articles that you are personally involved in.     As you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP:NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written.   Here is the fulltext, from WP:NOT:   Wikipedia is not a soapbox Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not: Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a \"\"sympathetic point of view\"\" for every article. Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: \"\"Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.\"\"  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability. Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small \"\"garage\"\" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability. -  I understand that you've written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan-related articles. That's a commendable position. I'm sure there are many subjects and articles of interest to you on Wikipedia that do not relate to your father or his opponents. Do I understand your position correctly? And is this approach of abstention one that you permanently take? If so, I again commend that position. I trust, as I'm sure you do, that the administrators and the contributors to Wikipedia will maintain quality articles about worthy and reputable subjects.  \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

He would have regarded this as \"\"a beautiful death\"\", despite having killed tens of millions of innocent Americans, despite the annihilation of Cuba and probably despite a global nuclear holocaust killing billions and destroying civilization. I am hoping you will expand the two sentences currently dealing with this and that you will summarize the incident in the intro.  \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "95843  Each alum agrees to how much information can be released to other alums and to the general public.  Whether you think it is stalking is irrelevant.  I believe you are throwing allegations of stalking because you are a petulant little boy who is stamping his feet because he didn't get his way.  You need metaphorically pantsed, your glasses thumbed, and your milk spilled.

Please take a look when you get the chance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "95849  Salafi would be a better term. It is more politically correct to use in Islam. Very few Muslims, even those who do not agree with those sects, use the term Islamist. The proper term used in Islamic circles is salafi, if anything.
